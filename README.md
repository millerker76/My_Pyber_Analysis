## Pyber Analysis


## Overview


### Purpose

* The purpose of this project is to provide visualizations and analysis of Pyber rides and fares during a 4-week period in 2019 in a sampling of rural, urban and suburban cities. 

* Specifically, the goal is to provide statistical and graphical models to better understand how weekly ride-share fare totals differ by city type (urban, suburban, rural).

### Data Description

Two data sets were provided: 
```
City dataset:   city name, city type, number of Pyber drivers

Ride data:      ride date, fare, ride_id

```
